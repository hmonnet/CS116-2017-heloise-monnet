**First project** Implement the recurrent spiking network described in //Brunel, N J. Comp Neuroscience 2000//. Reproduce a plot showing the spiking activity of neurons: - time increases along the horizontal axis, neuron id increases along the vertical axis - each dot corresponds to a spike of the respective neuron at a given time.  - the lower part of the figure shows a histogram with the mean firing-rate of the neurons The network must have at least 12500 neurons with 10% connection probability.
